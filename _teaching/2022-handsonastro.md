I was invited to co-prepare and co-tutor two sessions of the summerschool.
In the planet formation session with Bertram Bitsch, I helped students to develop a simple planetformationmodel. In the session about exoplanet climates with Ludmila Carone, I assisted students to run a climate model (MITgcm) and interpret climate model data.
