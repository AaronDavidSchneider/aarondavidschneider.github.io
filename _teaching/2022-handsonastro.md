I was invited to Coprepare and cotutor two sessions of the summerschool.
In the planet formation session with Bertram Bitsch, I helped students to develop a simple planetformationmodel. In the session about exoplanet climates with Ludmila Carone, I assisted students to run and interpret climate model data data with MITgcm.
