Under construction
======

I am a passionate physicist with expertise in climate modeling of hot gas giant exoplanets. (Soon) PhD holder in astrophysics and master's degree in physics. Experienced in emulating algorithms with machine learning and translating complex physical concepts into code. I am first author of six refereed publications and coauthor to several more. Seeking new opportunities and soon relocating to the Stuttgart region.

I am a Marie Sklodowska-Curie early stage researcher in astronomy and astrophysics in the [CHAMELEON](https://chameleon.iwf.oeaw.ac.at/ "CHAMELEON")<sup>1</sup> network, focusing on connecting the atmosphere and interior of extrasolar gas planets. From 2021 to 2022, I spent 18 months in Leuven, Belgium, collaborating with Leen Decin and Ludmila Carone. From March 2022 to the end of 2023, I completed the second half of my PhD in København, Denmark, working with Uffe Gråe Jørgensen.

Planetformation
======
During my master, I developed a global planet formation code [(chemcomp)](https://chemcomp.readthedocs.io/ "chemcomp"), capable of modeling the formation of planets in viscously evolving disks (including drift and evaporation of pebbles), while tracing their chemical composition of the forming planets. The [chemcomp](https://chemcomp.readthedocs.io/ "chemcomp") code [(Schneider & Bitsch 2021)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...654A..71S "Link to Publication"), which has now been used in 11 publications, is now also publically available!

Software development
======

In my spare time I occasionally contribute to [homeassistant](https://www.home-assistant.io "homeassistant") and the components [SonosAlarm](https://github.com/AaronDavidSchneider/SonosAlarm "SonosAlarm") and [FRITZ!Box Tools](https://github.com/mammuth/ha-fritzbox-tools "FRITZ!Box Tools") or work on extensions for [raycast](https://www.raycast.com/), such as [bibmanager](https://www.raycast.com/aaronschneider/bibmanager).
